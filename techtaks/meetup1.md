Please join us to talk about infrastructure as code. MessageMedia have kindly offered to host the meetup and will supply food and beverages.

We usually have 2 technical talks per meetup.

Talk #1 Jasmine - "Untouched by human hands: Using automation and Jenkins to build and operate under NIST"
Walk through some of the tools we have built to configure and run Terraform from versioned artefacts
The framework we use to manage Jenkins pipelines to run run jobs for Terraform, post-provisioning, deployments and operational tasks
Talk through how we use gitflow and versioning to promote changes through our environments. Using git as a an audit/change record
Speak to the benefits of repeatable builds and automation to reach and maintain security standards. The 'no more spreadsheets' approach to compliance.

Talk #2 Trent - "A look at building a new AWS multi account setup using AWS Control tower"
Starting from nothing, setting up AWS accounts is hard and time consuming. As a result AWS launched Control Tower to build this setup from scratch. Iâ€™ll talk through an ideal multi account structure and why, then using Control Tower to do it and then lastly talking about the pros and cons of using Control Tower

If you'd like to speak please contact Matt and David with a presentation topic, one paragraph description and estimate of the time you'll need.
